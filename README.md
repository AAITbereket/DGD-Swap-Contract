# DGD-Swap-Contract
This repo contains the code for the DGD Swap Contract. If you want to exchange your DGD tokens for Ether in an OTC manner, you can use this contract code to deploy your own contract through Mist. More information about deploying this contract can be found at - https://medium.com/p/6631490d4334/edit

In order to avoid all the hassles with the deployment, Attores is providing Smart Contracts as a Service. You can sign up at attores.com
